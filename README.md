# iti-JS-egg-game

An ITI task about a JavaScript Game which is like the old Chicken Invaders game. 
You have random eggs falling from the above of the screen at random places every time, 
and there's a basket at the bottom of the page where you're supposed to move it with arrow keys 
so you could catch the egg before it falls to the ground and breaks.
If you caught the egg, it falls inside your basket and you win. If you don't, the egg falls on the ground ana breaks, 
and you start a new game all over again where each egg falls down from a new random place.
